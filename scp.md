# **SCP:** become a SYNwall Certified Professional ;-)

This is not really serious, but it's an easy challenge: somewhere on the Internet, a SYNwall protected device is holding the awesome "SCP" badge, that you can proudly show to all your friends... ;-)

If you can download it, it means that you are a real SCP!

But where you can find it? Hints are in this page...

In case of troubles, try to reach out on Gitter.
